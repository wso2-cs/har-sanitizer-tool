                When you encounter issues with websites, providing network traces becomes crucial for troubleshooting.
                However, these traces might contain sensitive info like passwords and API keys, posing security risks.
                The HAR Sanitizer tool sanitizes sensitive data providing the capability to hash or remove entirely from your network traces,
                ensuring your session cookies, authorization headers, and more stay private.
                It works using client-side logic to sanitize HAR files, allowing you to share troubleshooting data without compromising security.
